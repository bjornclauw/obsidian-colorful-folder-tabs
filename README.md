- **Colored dot indicator** for top-level folders.  
- **Custom font weight** for:  
  - Main folders (top-level)  
  - Subfolders

## Installation

1. Download the latest release `.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/bjornclauw/colorful-folder-tabs/releases).  
2. Extract the contents into your Obsidian vault under `/.obsidian/plugins/colorful-folder-tabs/`.  
3. Open Obsidian, go to **Settings → Community Plugins → Colorful Folder Tabs**, and enable it.  


## Usage

1. Open **Settings → Colorful Folder Tabs**.  
2. Configure your folders:  
   - **Background color**: Pick a color for the folder.  
   - **Set text color**: Toggle and pick a custom text color.  
   - **Show colored dot**: Enable/disable small dot indicator for top-level folders.  
   - **Main folder font weight**: Adjust font weight for top-level folders.  
   - **Subfolder font weight**: Adjust font weight for subfolders.  
3. Toggle **Enable folder colors** to apply or remove styles.  

> Font weight and folder colors are independent — font weights are applied even if folder colors are disabled.  
> Folder colors are applied **without overriding your theme**, but the background color can be used by themes (like Blue Topaz) to determine folder style.  
> The plugin also **adds subtle highlights** in the file explorer and uses a **tab-style layout** for top-level folders.
